Socioeconomic Status Mostly Outweighs Psychological Factors in Predicting Individual Ecological Footprints 
This repository contains the data and code used in the research project examining the relationship between socioeconomic status (SES), psychological factors, and individual ecological footprints in six G7 countries, as outlined in the article submitted to PNAS.

Project Overview
The study explores the connections between socioeconomic status (SES), psychological factors, and individual ecological footprints using data from 5,069 participants across six G7 countries. The findings highlight that while psychological factors such as biospheric values are associated with smaller ecological footprints, SES has a much larger impact, with high SES individuals typically having larger footprints, particularly in relation to transportation activities. The study underscores the need for targeted strategies that address high-impact behaviors, particularly among affluent individuals, as psychological factors alone may not be enough to mitigate climate change.
